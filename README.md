# hybrid-cloud-security-labs
This repo documents my journey toward becoming a Cloud Security Architect (2025–2029).

Hi, I’m Ari, an IT professional on a 5-year journey to become a Hybrid Cloud Security Architect.
This repository documents my certifications, labs, and hands-on projects across Microsoft 365, Azure, AWS, GCP, and cybersecurity.

My focus areas include:
Cloud Infrastructure (Azure, AWS, GCP)
Identity & Access Management (Azure AD / Entra ID, M365)
Security Operations (SIEM, SOC, incident response)
Automation & Scripting (PowerShell, Azure CLI, ARM/Bicep, Graph API, Python)
Governance, Risk, and Compliance (NIST, CMMC, CISSP domains)

Repository Structure

Each folder will contain:
README.md → Summary of the lab/project
Scripts (PowerShell, Python, ARM/Bicep, etc.)
Configurations, JSON/YAML files
Screenshots, diagrams, or logs

Certifications (in-progress & completed)
Completed: Microsoft 365 Fundamentals (MS-900)
Current Year (2025): AZ-900, SC-900, SC-300, MD-102, ISC2 CC
Future: Security+, CySA+, Cloud+, AZ-104, SC-200, SC-401, SC-100, AZ-305, CISSP, and more

Roadmap (2025–2029)
This portfolio aligns with my 5-Year Hybrid Cloud Security Plan:
  Year 1: Foundations → Azure/M365 fundamentals, identity & endpoint management
  Year 2: Administration Expert → Azure admin, SOC monitoring, cloud+security certs
  Year 3: Advanced Security → Security admin/architect projects, multi-cloud skills
  Year 4: Enterprise Architecture → Zero Trust, governance, CCSP/AWS architect
  Year 5: Senior Security / Capstone → CISSP, SSCP, ISSAP, multi-cloud integration

Example Projects
- Azure Fundamentals Lab: Deploying VMs, storage, and monitoring with ARM/Bicep
- M365 Identity Automation: PowerShell + Graph API scripts for user lifecycle
- Endpoint Management: Intune device enrollment & compliance policies
- SOC Simulation: Sentinel alerts, KQL queries, incident response playbooks
- Multi-Cloud Hybrid Design: Secure workloads across Azure, AWS, and GCP
